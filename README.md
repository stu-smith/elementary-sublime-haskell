# ElementaryOS / Sublime Text  / Haskell

Setup for Haskell development on Sublime Text.


1. Install [ElementaryOS](http://elementary.io/)
2. Run the admin bits
  * wget link && sudo bash ./run-as-root.sh
3. Run the user bits
  * wget link && bash ./run-as-user.sh

NOTE: This is intended to be run on a new, clean install of Elementary OS.
Don't run it on an existing installation that has been used!

NOTE: Sublime Text integration doesn't quite work yet, due to problems with ghc-mod and hdevtools.
